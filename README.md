# CryptoUtilities.jl

`CryptoUtilities.jl` is a Julia package providing utilities for succinct proofs,
including hardware-optimized implementations of binary fields, Reed-Solomon
encodings, and Merkle trees with multiopening proofs.

## Features

- **Binary Fields**: Efficient arithmetic operations over binary fields.
- **Reed-Solomon Encoding**: Encoding and decoding using Reed-Solomon codes w/ `O(n log n)` cost, implementing [this paper](https://ieee-focs.org/FOCS-2014-Papers/6517a316.pdf).
- **Merkle Trees**: Construction, proof generation, and verification for Merkle tree batched openings.
- **ZODA Data Availability**: Reference implementation of the ZODA construction using Reed--Solomon encoding and Merkle tree commitments.

## Installation

To use `BinaryFields` or any of the other packages, simply add the package to your Julia environment:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("https://github.com/bcc-research/CryptoUtilities.jl.git", subdir="BinaryFields")
```
Replace `subdir="BinaryFields"` with `subdir="BinaryReedSolomon"` or
`subdir="BatchedMerkleTree"` to install the other packages.

(We are working on adding the packages to the Julia package registry, but for
now, you can install them directly from the GitHub repository.)

## Usage

### Notebooks

We provide examples and walkthroughs of the package (along with some Julia
basics) as [Pluto.jl](https://plutojl.org) notebooks in the
[CryptoUtilitiesNotebooks](https://github.com/bcc-research/CryptoUtilitiesNotebooks)
repository. We _highly_ recommend reading those, which should be all you need to
get started using this library. We also provide some (very basic) examples below, for
completeness.

### Binary Fields

```julia
using BinaryFields

a = BinaryElem16(0x1)
b = BinaryElem16(0x2)
c = a * b
println(c)
```

### Reed-Solomon Encoding

```julia
using BinaryReedSolomon

rs = reed_solomon(BinaryElem16, 256, 1024)
message = rand(BinaryElem16, 256)
encoded = encode(rs, message)
```

### Merkle Trees

```julia
using BatchedMerkleTree

leaves = [rand(UInt16, 4) for _ in 1:16]
tree = build_merkle_tree(leaves)
root = get_root(tree)
```

### ZODA Data Availability

```julia
using ZODA, BinaryFields

message = rand(BinaryElem16, 8)
inst = zoda_setup(BinaryElem16, 8, 16, message)
proof = zoda_prove(inst, [1, 4])
leaves = [inst.encoded[i] for i in (1,4)]
verified = zoda_verify(inst, proof, [1, 4], leaves)
```
